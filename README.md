- Python - There is ongoing issue with the official [**PEP8**](http://pep8online.com/) website to validate the Python code. So, as a workaround, PEP8 validator was added to my Gitpod workspace by these following steps:
    1. Run the command pip3 install pycodestyle.
    2. In the workspace, press Ctrl+Shift+P (or Cmd+Shift+P on Mac).
    3. Type the word linter into the search bar that appears, and click on Python: Select Linter from the filtered results.
    4. Select pycodestyle from the list.
    5. PEP8 errors will now be underlined in red, as well as being listed in the PROBLEMS tab beside your terminal.

    - As seen in the image below, there are no errors or problems detected in my workspace.

## Deployment ##
- The site was deployed to Heroku website. The steps to deploy are as follows:
    - Open a web browser (like Chrome, Firefox or Edge)
